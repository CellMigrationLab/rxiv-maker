# Figures Directory

Place your figure files here:

- `.mmd` files for Mermaid diagrams
- `.py` files for Python-generated figures  
- `.png`, `.pdf`, `.svg` files for static images
- `/DATA/` subdirectory for data files used in figure generation

The build process will automatically process these files and include them in your manuscript.
