---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - GitHub Workflows and Automation**

* **‚úÖ Simplify CI/CD**: Successfully consolidated and optimized GitHub Actions workflows with intelligent matrix strategies.
    * ‚úÖ **DONE**: **Created unified CI workflow** - Consolidated from 9 separate workflow files to 3 core workflows:
      - `ci.yml` - Unified CI/CD pipeline with matrix support for OS (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) and Python versions (3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
      - `docker-build.yml` - Consolidated Docker build/release pipeline with multi-platform and multi-engine support
      - `release-simple.yml` - Retained existing release workflow
    * ‚úÖ **DONE**: **Leveraged new nox parametrized sessions** - Workflows now use `nox -s "test(test_type='fast')"` and similar patterns for selective test execution

    * [ ] Convert the binary testing logic from a shell script into a Python-based `pytest` fixture or module. This makes the tests more portable, readable, and maintainable.
    * [ ] Use `pytest` hooks to dynamically discover and run binary-related tests, eliminating the need for a manually managed shell script.

---

## üîÆ Rxiv-Maker Future Enhancements

* **Playwright Integration**: The `rxiv_maker_colab_podman.ipynb` notebook will require local debugging.
    * [ ] Write a Playwright script to automate the testing of the notebook, including the `podman` installation and subsequent `rxiv` commands. This ensures a seamless user experience in a headless browser environment.
* **Advanced Configuration**: The configuration system is powerful but could be more robust.
    * [ ] Implement a full JSON Schema validation system to ensure that `00_CONFIG.yml` files are always well-formed and contain the correct data types. This prevents runtime errors caused by invalid configuration.
* **Plugin System**: A long-term goal is to move towards a modular plugin architecture, allowing users to extend functionality without modifying the core codebase.
    * [ ] Design and prototype a plugin system that allows for custom processors, validators, and output formats. This would enable community contributions and a more flexible platform.

# Homebrew Rxiv-Maker Repository Audit and Integration Plan

This document extends the previous audit by focusing on the `homebrew-rxiv-maker` tap and its deeper integration with the main `rxiv-maker` repository. The goal is to optimize the release process, streamline testing, and ensure a robust, reliable user experience for Homebrew users.

## üöÄ Strategic Goals

* **Release Automation**: Create a seamless, automated process to update the Homebrew formula whenever a new version of `rxiv-maker` is released.
* **Testing Synergy**: Integrate Homebrew testing into the main repository's CI/CD pipeline, making the `homebrew-rxiv-maker` tap a passive artifact of the main project.
* **Code Consolidation**: Eliminate redundant logic between the `noxfile.py`, `Makefile`, and shell scripts, centralizing all complex logic within Python.
* **Enhanced Reliability**: Improve the test suite to be more robust, faster, and more self-contained, reducing external dependencies and flakiness.

---

## üìù Better integration with homebrew-rxiv-maker (in ../homebrew-rxiv-maker)

### üîÑ CI/CD and Release Automation

* **Automate Formula Updates**: Currently, the formula's `url` and `sha256` hash in ../homebrew-rxiv-maker must be manually updated after each new release of `rxiv-maker`. This process is prone to error and delay.
    * [ ] Create a new GitHub Actions workflow in the main `rxiv-maker` repository. This workflow will trigger on a new release tag.
    * [ ] The workflow should download the new `.tar.gz` artifact, calculate its `sha256` hash, and create a pull request in the `homebrew-rxiv-maker` repository to update the `rxiv-maker.rb` file with the new `url` and `sha256`.
    * [ ] Use a dedicated bot account or a fine-grained personal access token to authenticate and push the pull request.
* **Integrate Tap Testing**: The tap's testing is currently managed separately via its own `noxfile.py` and `Makefile`. This is inefficient.
    * [ ] Migrate the `test/Containerfile` and `test/test_homebrew_linux.py` to the main `rxiv-maker` repository.
    * [ ] Create a new `nox` session in the main repository's `noxfile.py` (e.g., `test-homebrew`) that executes the Homebrew formula tests.
    * [ ] Update the main `rxiv-maker` CI workflow to include the `nox -s test-homebrew` command, ensuring that every push to `main` and every new release is Homebrew-compatible before the tap is updated.
* **Simplify Tap Workflows**: The `Makefile` in the tap repository is a wrapper for `nox` commands.
    * [ ] Deprecate the `Makefile` and instruct developers to use `nox` directly. This removes a layer of abstraction and simplifies the development process for contributors.
    * [ ] Remove the `update-hash` make target and replace it with instructions to use the new automated workflow or a dedicated Python script if manual intervention is necessary.

### üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

* **Improve Test Reliability**: The current `test/test_homebrew_linux.py` script contains complex adaptive logic, which can be hard to maintain and debug.
    * [ ] Refactor the `test_homebrew_linux.py` script to use a simpler, more robust approach. Instead of adaptive modes, create separate, clearly defined `nox` sessions for fast vs. full testing.
    * [ ] Remove the `ADAPTIVE_MODE` and `FORCE_FULL` environment variables from the test script and instead rely on `nox` session parameters or `pytest` markers.
    * [ ] Replace the `subprocess` calls in the test script with a more modern and robust library for process execution, like `sh` or `execa` in a hypothetical JavaScript context, or a well-wrapped Python function that handles output streaming and error codes cleanly.
* **Consolidate Python Logic**: The `noxfile.py` and the `test_homebrew_linux.py` script contain duplicated logic for environment and command checks.
    * [ ] Extract common functions, such as `_command_exists` and `run_command`, into a shared utility module to be used by both `noxfile.py` and the test scripts.
* **Streamline Container Builds**: The `test/Containerfile` has a complex, multi-stage build logic with conditional `PREINSTALL_DEPS`.
    * [ ] Separate the container build into two distinct `Containerfile`s: one for the base image with no preinstalled dependencies and another for a fully-cached image. This simplifies the build logic and makes the `nox` session cleaner, as it can choose which image to build and use.
    * [ ] Use `podman`'s build cache more effectively by splitting the `RUN` commands into smaller, more granular layers. For instance, `apt-get update` should be in a separate layer from `apt-get install`.

### üìö Documentation and User Experience

* **Simplify the `README.md`**: The `README.md` contains troubleshooting information, but some of this may be better placed in a dedicated `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a `Troubleshooting` section on the main project website.
    * [ ] Relocate the Homebrew-specific troubleshooting section to the main `rxiv-maker` documentation, keeping the tap's `README.md` focused solely on installation and basic usage.
    * [ ] Add a clear link to the main `rxiv-maker` project's documentation for all advanced features and detailed usage instructions, reinforcing the idea that the tap is a distribution channel, not the source of truth for documentation.
* **Improve Formula Caveats**: The `caveats` section in `rxiv-maker.rb` provides excellent, but lengthy, information.
    * [ ] Review the `caveats` section for opportunities to simplify it. Focus on the most critical information, such as the `rxiv check-installation` command and the link to the full documentation.
    * [ ] Remove the shell completion warning, as it's a standard part of Homebrew installations and can be handled in a more general troubleshooting guide.

--- 
## üì¶ APT Repository Implementation
The goal of this section is to establish a fully automated, official APT repository for rxiv-maker hosted directly on the GitHub repository.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Packaging and Build Process

* [ ] **Create Debian Package Files**: Add a `debian/` directory to the `rxiv-maker` repository. This directory will contain the necessary files (`control`, `changelog`, `copyright`, `rules`) to build a `.deb` package.
* [ ] **Define a Build Strategy**: Implement a build process to create the `.deb` package from the `rxiv-maker` source. We should use `dh-virtualenv` or a similar tool to package the Python application and its dependencies into a self-contained `.deb` file, ensuring a clean installation.
* [ ] **Generate the GPG Key**: Create a dedicated GPG key to sign the APT repository. The private key will be stored securely as a GitHub Actions secret. The public key will be a publicly available artifact in the repository.

### üåê Repository Hosting and Management

* [ ] **Use `raw.githubusercontent.com` for Hosting**: The repository will be hosted on a dedicated branch (e.g., `apt-repo`) and served directly from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenriquesLab/rxiv-maker/apt-repo/`. This removes the need for GitHub Pages.
* [ ] **Automate Repository Creation**: Create a dedicated Python or shell script to manage the repository on the `apt-repo` branch. This script will:
    * Take the newly built `.deb` package as input.
    * Use `dpkg-scanpackages` to generate the `Packages` file.
    * Use `gzip` to compress the `Packages` file.
    * Use `gpg` to sign the `Release` file, creating a `Release.gpg` and an `InRelease` file.
* [ ] **Update the Repository Structure**: The script will push the updated `Packages`, `Release`, and `InRelease` files, along with the `.deb` package, to the `apt-repo` branch.

### üöÄ GitHub Actions and Automation

* [ ] **New `publish-apt.yml` Workflow**: Create a new GitHub Actions workflow in the main `rxiv-maker` repository. This workflow will be triggered on a new release or when a release is published.
* [ ] **Workflow Steps**: The workflow will perform the following actions:
    * Check out the `rxiv-maker` code.
    * Install the necessary Debian packaging tools.
    * Build the `.deb` package.
    * Add the `.deb` file as a release asset in the current GitHub release.
    * Check out the `apt-repo` branch.
    * Run the repository management script to add the new `.deb` package and regenerate all metadata files.
    * Commit and push the changes to the `apt-repo` branch.

### üìñ Documentation and Integration

* [ ] **Update `README.md`**: Add a new "Installation via APT Repository" section to the main `rxiv-maker` `README.md`. This section should provide clear, copyable instructions for users.
* [ ] **Provide Clear Instructions**: The instructions will detail how to add the public GPG key, add the repository to the system's `sources.list.d` using the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL, update the package index, and install `rxiv-maker`.
* [ ] **Reference in Homebrew Tap**: Update the `homebrew-rxiv-maker` `README.md` to mention the new APT repository as an alternative installation method for Linux users. This will prevent users from manually installing Homebrew on Debian-based systems if they do not want to.
  
---

To add inline code execution for Python and R to the manuscript generation process, you can extend the `rxiv-maker` codebase with the following plan. The key is to integrate code evaluation within the Markdown-to-LaTeX conversion pipeline and securely manage the execution environment.

---

### üíª Inline Code Execution for Manuscripts

* [ ] **Create a Dedicated Engine**: Develop a new, isolated **code execution engine** within the `rxiv_maker` package. This engine will be responsible for securely running Python and R code. It should be a modular component that can be easily updated or replaced in the future.
* [ ] **Define Markdown Syntax**: Establish a clear and intuitive syntax for inline code blocks within the Markdown manuscripts. For example, you can use a custom fenced code block or an inline macro, such as:
    * Fenced code block: ````{python}` ... ```` `
    * Inline macro: `{{python: code_to_run}}` or `{{R: code_to_run}}`
* [ ] **Integrate with the Conversion Pipeline**: Modify the `md2tex` conversion script to detect and process these new code blocks. When a code block is identified, the script should:
    * [ ] **Extract the Code**: Parse the Markdown to isolate the code snippet and its language (Python or R).
    * [ ] **Call the Execution Engine**: Pass the code to the new code execution engine.
    * [ ] **Insert the Output**: Take the output from the engine and insert it back into the Markdown stream at the appropriate location. This output could be text, a figure, or a table.
* [ ] **Containerize the Execution Environment**: To ensure security and reproducibility, the code execution engine should run within isolated container environments. This prevents malicious or buggy code from affecting the host system.
    * [ ] **Podman/Docker Integration**: Configure the engine to use **Podman or Docker** to spin up lightweight containers for each code block. The containers will have Python and R preinstalled, along with any common scientific libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy, ggplot2).
    * [ ] **Secure Volume Mounting**: Carefully manage volume mounts to prevent containerized code from accessing sensitive files outside of the manuscript's directory.
* [ ] **Create a Dynamic Data Update Example**: Develop a concrete example to demonstrate the new feature. This will involve:
    * [ ] **Python Script for `SFigure__preprint_trends`**: Create a Python script that pulls data, analyzes it, and generates a new figure for `SFigure__preprint_trends`.
    * [ ] **Dynamic Last-Updated Timestamp**: Add an inline code block to the manuscript that executes a Python script to retrieve the current date and time. The output of this script will be inserted into the manuscript text, dynamically updating the "last pulled" timestamp every time the manuscript is built.

--- 

### Testing Strategy Review and Plan

This section outlines a comprehensive review of the testing strategy for `rxiv-maker`, focusing on a minor version update and the associated Pull Request (PR) process. The goal is to ensure a robust, efficient, and reliable testing pipeline that guarantees the quality of new features.

---

### üß™ Test Automation and Coverage

* [ ] **Unit Tests**: Ensure every new function, class, and module has a corresponding set of unit tests using `pytest`. Aim for 100% code coverage on all new code. Existing tests should be reviewed for clarity and completeness.
* [ ] **Integration Tests**: Expand the integration test suite to cover all new features. A new integration test should be added to validate the full workflow of inline code execution, from parsing a Markdown file with a code block to producing a PDF with the correct output.
* [ ] **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Create a dedicated E2E test for the new inline code execution feature. This test will use a realistic manuscript file with both Python and R code blocks and verify the final PDF output. The test should check for the presence of the dynamic timestamp and the correct figure details.
* [ ] **Security and Sandboxing Tests**: Write a new test suite to specifically audit the containerized execution environment. These tests will attempt to perform malicious actions, like accessing files outside the mounted directory or running privileged commands, to ensure the sandboxing is effective.
* [ ] **Platform Matrix Testing**: Update the CI workflows to run tests across a matrix of operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and Python versions (e.g., 3.11, 3.12). This will guarantee cross-platform compatibility for the new features.

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Minor Version Update

A minor version update (e.g., from `1.4.25` to `1.5.0`) is appropriate for this release, as it introduces new functionality without breaking existing public APIs.

* [ ] **Update `pyproject.toml`**: Increment the version number in `pyproject.toml` to the new minor version.
* [ ] **Update `rxiv-maker.rb`**: The Homebrew formula (`rxiv-maker.rb`) will need to be updated with the new version number and the corresponding SHA256 hash of the new release tarball.
* [ ] **Update `changelog.md`**: Create a detailed changelog entry for the new version. This entry should describe the new features (inline code execution, dynamic data updates), any bug fixes, and improvements to the testing pipeline.
* [ ] **Tag the Release**: After merging the changes, create a new Git tag (e.g., `v1.5.0`) and push it to the remote repository. This will trigger the automated release workflows.

---

### ü§ù Pull Request (PR) Process

* [ ] **Descriptive Title and Body**: The PR title should clearly state the purpose of the PR (e.g., "Feature: Inline Code Execution for Python and R"). The body should provide a concise summary of the changes, a list of new features, and a link to the relevant issue.
* [ ] **Checklist and Reviewers**: Include a checklist in the PR description to ensure all necessary steps have been completed (e.g., documentation updated, tests written, version number incremented). Assign the PR to a reviewer for thorough code review.
* [ ] **Link to Artifacts**: The PR should include links to the CI/CD job artifacts, such as test coverage reports, linting results, and the generated `.deb` package from the automated build.
* [ ] **Merge**: Once the PR has passed all CI checks and received a positive review, it can be merged into the `main` branch. The merge should trigger a final release workflow to publish the new version.
