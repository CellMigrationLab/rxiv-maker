# TODO.MD Migration Strategy - Multi-Agent Coordination Format

## Executive Summary

This document proposes a migration strategy to transform the existing comprehensive todo.md (833 lines) into a standardized format optimized for multi-agent coordination while preserving all valuable content and context.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths of Current Format
- **Excellent organization** with clear sections and priorities
- **Rich context** with file paths, line numbers, and technical details
- **Progress tracking** with completion percentages and metrics
- **Historical record** of completed work and achievements
- **Visual hierarchy** using emojis and formatting

### Areas for Standardization
- Mixed task state indicators (checkboxes, emojis, text)
- Inconsistent priority systems (colors, text, positioning)
- Nested subtasks without clear parent-child relationships
- Long narrative descriptions mixed with actionable items

---

## Proposed Standardized Format

### Task Structure
```yaml
- id: RXIV-001
  title: "Fix NotImplementedError placeholders in bibliography_cache.py"
  status: ready  # ready | blocked | in_progress | completed | cancelled
  priority: critical  # critical | high | medium | low
  category: bug_fix
  assigned_to: null
  blocked_by: []
  dependencies: []
  location:
    file: src/rxiv_maker/utils/bibliography_cache.py
    lines: [387, 403, 414]
  description: |
    Placeholder functions returning safe defaults need actual implementation:
    - Line 387: Bibliography parsing logic
    - Line 403: DOI validation logic  
    - Line 414: Citation analysis logic
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Implement actual parsing logic for bibliography
    - Add comprehensive error handling
    - Write unit tests with >90% coverage
  estimated_effort: 4h
  tags: [technical_debt, core_functionality]
```

### Status Definitions
- **ready**: Task can be started immediately
- **blocked**: Waiting on dependencies or external factors
- **in_progress**: Currently being worked on
- **completed**: Finished and verified
- **cancelled**: No longer needed

### Priority Levels
- **critical**: Must be done before next release
- **high**: Should be done in current sprint
- **medium**: Important but not urgent
- **low**: Nice to have improvements

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current todo.md
```bash
cp todo.md todo_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).md
```

### Step 2: Create New Structured Sections
```markdown
# 📝 RXIV-MAKER TASK TRACKER

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-14
**Format Version**: 2.0 (Multi-Agent Coordination)
**Active Sprint**: Test Coverage Push

## 🚨 CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required
[Tasks with status: ready, priority: critical]

## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY - Current Sprint
[Tasks with status: ready, priority: high]

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Active Development
[Tasks with status: in_progress]

## ⏸️ BLOCKED - Waiting on Dependencies
[Tasks with status: blocked]

## 📋 BACKLOG - Future Work
[Tasks with status: ready, priority: medium/low]

## ✅ COMPLETED - Recent Achievements
[Tasks with status: completed, last 30 days]

## 📊 METRICS & TRACKING
[Coverage reports, statistics, progress indicators]
```

### Step 3: Transform Tasks to Structured Format

Example transformation:

**Before:**
```markdown
- [ ] Fix empty `pass` in exception handlers:
  - `generate_figures.py:160` - Cache update failure silently ignored
  - `cache_management.py:235` - ValueError/TypeError silently ignored
```

**After:**
```yaml
- id: RXIV-005
  title: "Fix empty exception handlers"
  status: ready
  priority: high
  category: bug_fix
  subtasks:
    - id: RXIV-005.1
      file: generate_figures.py:160
      issue: "Cache update failure silently ignored"
    - id: RXIV-005.2
      file: cache_management.py:235
      issue: "ValueError/TypeError silently ignored"
```

### Step 4: Add Automation Metadata

Each task should include:
- Unique ID for tracking
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort (when possible)
- Tags for categorization
- Dependencies for sequencing

### Step 5: Preserve Historical Context

Create separate sections:
- `CHANGELOG.md` - For completed work
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - For technical decisions
- `METRICS.md` - For coverage and performance tracking

---

## Benefits of Migration

### For Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Clear task boundaries** - Each agent knows exactly what to work on
- **Dependency tracking** - Prevents conflicts and ensures proper sequencing
- **Status visibility** - Real-time understanding of what's available to work on
- **Priority alignment** - Agents work on most important tasks first

### For Human Developers
- **Reduced cognitive load** - Structured format easier to scan
- **Better progress tracking** - Clear status indicators
- **Improved handoffs** - Context preserved in structured fields
- **Historical preservation** - Completed work archived properly

## Conclusion

The proposed migration preserves all valuable content while creating a standardized format optimized for multi-agent coordination. The phased approach ensures no information is lost while improving task management efficiency.

Key improvements:
- Standardized status and priority systems
- Clear dependency tracking
- Structured metadata for automation
- Preserved historical context
- Improved readability and maintenance

The migration can be completed incrementally, starting with critical tasks and gradually transforming the entire document.
