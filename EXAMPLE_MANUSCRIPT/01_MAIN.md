# RXiv-Maker: An Automated Template Engine for Streamlined Scientific Publications
<!-- note that this title is not rendered in the PDF, rather the one in the YAML metadata is used -->

## Abstract
Modern scientific publishing has moved towards rapid dissemination through preprint servers, putting greater demands on researchers for preparing and quality-checking manuscripts. We introduce RXiv-Maker, a focused, lightweight system native to GitHub that streamlines scientific writing through markdown-based authoring with automated LaTeX conversion. Designed to bridge the gap between accessible writing tools and professional typesetting, the system prioritises reproducibility through native GitHub Actions integration rather than attempting to serve multiple output formats or user profiles. RXiv-Maker offers a deliberate, opinionated workflow that integrates version control and automation practices into scientific writing, including cloud-based GitHub Actions with native LaTeX installation, interactive Google Colab notebooks, and reproducible local builds via virtual environments. The framework ensures reproducibility by providing automated build environments with controlled dependency management and version-controlled workflows. This self-documenting article, created entirely within the framework, demonstrates how this approach offers an efficient, collaborative, and transparent workflow for producing reproducible preprints, empowering researchers to focus on content while maintaining rigorous standards of scientific integrity.

## Main

<!-- Introduction -->

![](FIGURES/Figure_1.svg)
{#fig:diagram tex_position="t"} **The RXiv-Maker Diagram.** The system integrates Markdown content, YAML metadata, Python scripts, and bibliography files through a processing engine. This engine leverages GitHub Actions, virtual environments, and LaTeX to produce a publication-ready scientific article, demonstrating a fully automated and reproducible pipeline.

Today's scientific landscape is marked by the swift sharing of research findings, a trend largely driven by the exponential growth of preprint servers like arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv [@Berg2016;@Abdill2019_biorxiv_growth;@Fraser2021_preprint_growth]. The remarkable scale of this growth is illustrated in @sfig:arxiv-growth. This shift, while accelerating scientific discovery and enhancing research transparency [@Vale2019_preprints;@Tennant2016_academic_publishing], has transferred the burden of quality control, typesetting, and reproducibility assurance directly onto authors. Traditional workflows, often reliant on proprietary binary formats, hinder effective version control with systems like Git, while manual synchronisation of contributions is both error-prone and inefficient [@Lariviere2014;@da_Silva_2022_challenges]. To address these challenges, we have developed RXiv-Maker, a GitHub-native framework that embraces a focused, developer-centric approach to scientific manuscript preparation. Rather than attempting to serve diverse output formats or complex multi-format workflows, RXiv-Maker is deliberately designed to excel at a single, critical task: producing high-quality PDF preprints efficiently and reproducibly. This focused approach allows researchers to leverage familiar markdown syntax while benefiting from professional LaTeX typesetting, without requiring extensive technical expertise. The framework is built on the principle of computational reproducibility, providing automated guardrails that would typically be the domain of journal production staff. By leveraging GitHub Actions with native LaTeX environments and controlled dependency management, RXiv-Maker ensures that manuscripts can be rebuilt consistently across different systems and time periods, addressing the fundamental challenge of computational preservation in scientific publishing.

{#fig:workflow width="\textwidth" tex_position="t"} **RXiv-Maker Workflow: User Input vs. Automated Processing.** The framework clearly separates user responsibilities (content creation and configuration) from automated processes (parsing, conversion, compilation, and output generation). Users only need to write content and set preferences, while the system handles all technical aspects of manuscript preparation automatically, ensuring a streamlined workflow from markdown input to publication-ready PDF output.

RXiv-Maker prioritizes reproducibility throughout the publication process [@Donoho2010;@Sandve2013_reproducible_research;@Wilson2014_software_carpentry]. The framework enables programmatic generation of figures and tables, following computational research best practices [@Scherer2020_reproducibility]. Instead of using static image files, which disconnect data from visualization, the system uses scripting languages like Python with visualization libraries such as Matplotlib [@Hunter2007_matplotlib] and Seaborn [@Waskom2021_seaborn]. Figures are generated directly from source data and analysis scripts during compilation, creating a direct link from raw data to final figure. When underlying data is updated or analysis is refined, affected figures are automatically regenerated, ensuring consistency and preventing outdated visuals. The system also integrates Mermaid.js [@Mermaid2023_documentation] for generating diagrams and flowcharts from text-based syntax, useful for illustrating experimental workflows, conceptual models, and algorithms. The complete range of supported figure generation methods is detailed in @stable:figure-formats. This approach treats the manuscript as an executable output of the research process rather than a static document. Built upon the established HenriquesLab bioRxiv template [@HenriquesLab2015_template], RXiv-Maker extends capabilities through automated processing pipelines and flexible deployment strategies. The architecture, detailed in @fig:diagram and comprehensively illustrated in @fig:workflow, provides robust build automation through GitHub Actions and virtual environments. The technical details of the figure generation system are described in @snote:figure-generation.

To understand RXiv-Maker's distinct features, it is important to position it within the broader ecosystem of scientific authoring tools. The current landscape can be broadly categorised into distinct paradigms, each reflecting different philosophical approaches to document creation. All-in-one publishing systems like Quarto are designed for maximum versatility, integrating features for multi-language, multi-format output from a single source. Real-time collaborative editors such as Overleaf democratise LaTeX authoring through web-based interfaces with low technical barriers. Computational narrative frameworks like MyST and Jupyter Book treat documents as executable entities, prioritising web-first, interactive outputs. Modern typesetting engines like Typst represent a fundamental rethinking of the typesetting process with cleaner syntax and faster compilation. RXiv-Maker occupies a specific niche within this ecosystem: developer-centric automation optimised for reproducible PDF preprint generation, with workflow reproducibility as its core strength. A detailed comparison of these approaches is provided in @stable:tool-comparison, with extended analysis in @snote:comparison.

<!-- Results -->

Using the RXiv-Maker framework results in a highly efficient and robust workflow for producing professional-quality scientific papers. The system's primary output is a fully typeset PDF document, as seen in the article you're currently reading, which was generated entirely using this process. The markdown source files are automatically converted into a structured LaTeX document, then compiled to produce a PDF with a clean, academic layout, proper pagination, and high-resolution figures. Bibliographic management is handled seamlessly through integration with a standard BibTeX file. The system automatically processes this file to generate correctly formatted in-text citations and a comprehensive bibliography section according to a specified citation style. This automation eliminates the tedious and error-prone task of manually formatting references.

The system's deployment strategy addresses a fundamental challenge in computational reproducibility: ensuring that research outputs can be reliably reconstructed across different environments and time periods. The cloud-based GitHub Actions workflow represents a paradigm shift from local, environment-dependent builds to standardised, auditable compilation processes. Every repository push triggers an automated workflow that provisions a fresh, controlled environment with specific versions of LaTeX, Python, and system dependencies. This approach eliminates the variability introduced by different local installations and provides a permanent, citable record of the exact computational environment used for each manuscript version. The resulting PDF artifacts are automatically archived and made available for download, creating an unbroken chain of computational provenance from source files to final output. For users requiring immediate feedback, the system also supports deployment in Google Colab notebooks, providing an interactive environment that maintains the same reproducibility guarantees while offering real-time compilation capabilities. A comprehensive comparison of available deployment strategies is provided in @stable:deployment-options.

The integration of programmatic figure generation was also validated, supporting interactive computational environments like Jupyter notebooks [@Jupyter2016_notebook]. Python scripts placed within the designated directory were automatically executed during compilation. These scripts loaded data, performed analyses, and generated visualisations, which were then saved as image files and seamlessly included in the final PDF. Similarly, Mermaid.js diagrams embedded within the markdown source were correctly rendered into SVG images and incorporated into the document. This programmatic integration demonstrates a closed loop of reproducibility, where the final manuscript serves as a verifiable and self-contained record of the research findings and their presentation.

<!-- Discussion and conclusions section -->

By integrating plain-text authoring with automated build environments, RXiv-Maker provides a robust solution to the challenges of ensuring consistency and reproducibility in manuscript preparation. The framework's focused approach—optimising for a single, critical task rather than attempting broad functionality—enables deeper integration with version control systems and automation practices that are essential for modern research workflows. This specialisation allows the system to excel at what matters most for scientific preprints: reliability, reproducibility, and seamless integration with collaborative research practices. The approach embraces literate programming principles [@Knuth1984_literate_programming], creating documents that seamlessly blend narrative text with executable code. Rather than forcing researchers to become amateur typesetters, the system handles typesetting complexity while preserving the transparent, version-controlled workflow that modern research demands. The integration with Git provides transparent attribution, conflict-free merging of contributions, and a complete, auditable history of manuscript development [@Ram2013_git_science;@Perez-Riverol2016_github_bioinformatics].

The rise of preprints has fundamentally shifted the burden of quality control, typesetting, and reproducibility assurance from journal production staff directly onto authors. RXiv-Maker responds to this cultural shift by providing the automated guardrails that researchers now need to produce publication-quality work from the very first public dissemination of their findings. By focusing on automated figure generation and standardised build processes, the framework makes it straightforward to create publications that are not just reports of research, but are themselves computationally reproducible artefacts. This directly addresses the 'reproducibility crisis' by embedding best practices into the authoring workflow itself [@Donoho2010]. The framework's GitHub-native design leverages the infrastructure that has become the de facto standard for collaborative software development and is increasingly adopted for scientific projects, positioning researchers to benefit from the maturity and reliability of modern development practices. Additional details on the reproducibility features and version control integration are provided in @snote:reproducibility.

The deliberate focus on PDF output via LaTeX represents a conscious design choice to optimise the preprint workflow rather than a limitation. While this specialisation means the system does not currently support HTML or other web-native formats, this focused approach enables deeper optimisation for the specific requirements of scientific preprint preparation. Future development could extend format support through integration with universal document converters like Pandoc [@MacFarlane2022], though this would require careful consideration of how to maintain the current level of typographic control and reproducibility guarantees. The learning curve associated with Git and markdown workflows reflects the investment required to leverage modern version control practices, which yield significant dividends in reproducibility and collaboration capabilities. Concerns about reporting quality in preprints [@Kirkham2018_reporting] suggest opportunities for integrating automated quality checks and validation workflows. Future development will focus on deeper integration with data analysis environments like Jupyter notebooks and exploration of automated tools for style, grammar, and scientific rigour assessment, further enhancing the system's role as a comprehensive manuscript preparation platform. Advanced template customisation and styling options are detailed in @snote:customisation.

## Methods

The following section provides a detailed technical description of the RXiv-Maker framework, serving as both the methods for this paper and as a practical demonstration of the system's capacity for generating complex, structured documentation from source code and plain text. A comprehensive overview of the system architecture is provided in @sfig:architecture.

### Processing Pipeline
The RXiv-Maker framework uses a multi-stage pipeline orchestrated by a central `Makefile` to convert manuscript source files into a compiled PDF. The workflow ensures a reproducible build process through several stages: environment setup, conditional generation of programmatic content, markdown-to-LaTeX conversion, asset aggregation, and final typesetting using a robust `pdflatex` sequence to resolve all cross-references and citations. For users without a local LaTeX setup, the framework provides identical build capabilities in the cloud via GitHub Actions. The project's file structure is detailed in @snote:file-structure.

### Markdown-to-LaTeX Conversion
Manuscript conversion is handled by a custom Python engine that processes an "extended academic Markdown" syntax. This multi-pass process first protects code blocks, then converts specialized elements like citations (`@smith2023`), figures, tables, and supplementary notes, before applying standard markdown formatting. This ensures complex academic syntax is handled correctly. A full syntax overview is in @stable:markdown-syntax, with technical details in @snote:markdown-conversion. Support for mathematical notation is described in @snote:mathematical-formulas and @snote:numbered-equations.

### Programmatic Content and Environments
A core feature is programmatic content generation, treating figures and diagrams as reproducible outputs. The build pipeline automatically executes scripts (e.g., Python, Mermaid) and uses caching to avoid redundant work. This ensures a verifiable link between data, code, and visualizations (@snote:figure-generation). To ensure reproducibility, RXiv-Maker uses a multi-layered environment management strategy. Dependencies are pinned, and isolated local virtual environments are supported. For maximum consistency, GitHub Actions provides controlled, cloud-based build environments, guaranteeing reproducibility across systems and time.

### Quality Assurance
The framework's reliability is ensured by a multi-level validation protocol. Unit tests validate individual components, integration tests verify the end-to-end pipeline, and platform tests validate behavior in deployment environments like GitHub Actions. Additionally, a pre-commit pipeline enforces code formatting, linting, and type checking, ensuring high code quality.
