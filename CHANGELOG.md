## Project History

**Rxiv-Maker** started as "Article-Forge" in June 2025, developed to bridge the gap between easy scientific writing in Markdown and professional LaTeX output. The project has evolved through several major iterations:

- **June 2025**: Initial development as Article-Forge
- **June 2025**: Renamed to RXiv-Forge, then standardized to Rxiv-Maker
- **June-July 2025**: Rapid development with 250+ commits
- **July 2025**: Major feature additions including R script support

The project emphasizes reproducible science workflows, automated figure generation, and professional typesetting while maintaining accessibility through familiar Markdown syntax.
