\section{Methods}

This section describes the design and implementation of the Article-Forge template engine.

\subsection{Template Architecture}

The Article-Forge template is built upon the following core components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HenriquesLab LaTeX style class (\texttt{HenriquesLab\_style.cls})
    \item Custom bibliography style (\texttt{HenriquesLab\_style.bst})
    \item Modular document structure with separate section files
    \item Automated build system using Make and shell scripts
    \item Docker containerization for reproducible builds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Build System Design}

The template includes a comprehensive build system that automates document compilation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Makefile} for cross-platform build automation
    \item Shell scripts for cleaning and building documents
    \item Three-pass LaTeX compilation for proper cross-references
    \item Automated bibliography processing with BibTeX
    \item Error handling and logging for troubleshooting
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Template Features}

Key features of the Article-Forge template include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Professional typography optimized for scientific publications
    \item Integrated figure and table management
    \item Comprehensive bibliography support with custom formatting
    \item Supplementary material handling
    \item Flexible author and affiliation management
    \item Cross-reference automation for figures, tables, and citations
\end{itemize}

The template demonstrates its capabilities through self-documentation, where this very article serves as both an example and documentation of the template's features. All build processes are automated and reproducible across different computing environments.
